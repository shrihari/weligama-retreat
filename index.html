      <h1>About your host</h1>
      <p>Hi! I am Guni! my passion for health and wellness has been a driving force in my life. It began with my personal health journey and has since inspired many of my career choices. I founded a complementary healthcare application called <a href="http://dotiv.life" target="_blank">dotiv</a>, host a lifestyle medicine podcast (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/dotivthepodcast/" target="_blank">@dotivthepodcast</a>), and currently work for the World Health Organisation. My goal is to empower others to prioritize their health and well-being, and this retreat is a perfect opportunity to do just that.</p>
